were no strangers to love
you know the rules and so do I
a full commitments what im thinking of
you wouldn't get this from any other guy

i just want to tell you how im feeling
gotta make you understand

never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
never gonna run around and desert you
never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

weve known each other for so long
your hearts been aching but youre too shy to say it
inside we both know whats been going on
we know the game and were gonna play it

and if you ask me how im feeling
dont tell me you're too blind to see

never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
never gonna run around and desert you
never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
never gonna run around and desert you
never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

weve known each other for so long
your hearts been aching but you're too shy to say it
inside we both know whats been going on
we know the game and were gonna play it

i just want to tell you how im feeling
gotta make you understand

never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
never gonna run around and desert you
never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
